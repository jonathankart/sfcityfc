				"en": "The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank's Flor de Chupol Group was formed in the rural area of Chichicastenango called, Chuipol. There are ten women in the group, all of whom have a great desire to empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives. They see hope in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge that combines small loans and education on a variety of practical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is a young, 23-year-old woman, named Juana, who married quite young. Juana has a textile business and creates typical blouses that are elaborately decorated. She employs three women. \r\n\r\nJuana is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she hopes will be funded by Kiva investors. She will use the funds to purchase a quantity of good-quality thread, as well as other supplies for the business. Juana realizes that this is the time of the year when demand increases due to the holidays, graduations, and other celebrations.\r\n\r\nHer three young children motivate her to work hard, so that they can have nutritious food on the table and attend school. One of her children is already in school and another is about to begin his education. Juana was able to attend elementary school and realizes the value of a good education. She is optimistic about the future. The women in the Trust Bank admire Juana because she knows how to read and write. She is inspirational to her friends in the Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank's Flor de Chuipol Group very much appreciates the opportunity to participate in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge. Through their kindness and generosity in funding these much needed loans, Kiva investors are valuable partners. Thank you! "
